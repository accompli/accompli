An easy to use and extendable deployment tool for PHP projects.

> *C'est fini. Accompli!*

## Installation using Composer

Run the following command to add the package to the composer.json of your project:

``` bash
$ composer require accompli/accompli --dev
```

#### Versioning
Accompli uses [Semantic Versioning 2](http://semver.org/) for new versions.

## Usage
1. Create an accompli.json defining the hosts to deploy to and the tasks to run during install and deployment.

  By running the following command, Accompli will guide you in creating a basic accompli.json configuration:
  ``` bash
  $ vendor/bin/accompli init
  ```

  *Note that below example might not work for your project.*

  ``` json
  {
    "$extend": "accompli://recipe/defaults.json",
    "hosts": [
      {
        "stage": "test",
        "connectionType": "ssh",
        "hostname": "example.com",
        "path": "/var/www/example.com"
      }
    ],
    "events": {
      "subscribers": [
        {
          "class": "Accompli\\Task\\CreateWorkspaceTask"
        },
        {
          "class": "Accompli\\Task\\RepositoryCheckoutTask",
          "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/example.com/example.com.git"
        },
        {
          "class": "Accompli\\Task\\DeployReleaseTask"
        },
        {
          "class": "Accompli\\Task\\MaintenanceModeTask"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

2. Run Accompli to install a release of your project: `vendor/bin/accompli install-release <version>`
